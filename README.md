##HackKU Memer
This is the (very simple) backend for a workshop I'm running at HackKU that's meant to teach people without much programming experience enough to participate in a hackathon.

This repository is a simple web server with three endpoints (one currently) - one to get a random meme from `images/`,and another two to get and put new meme creations.

###Installation
Clone this repository using
```
https://github.com/ehiggins98/HackKU-Workshop
```
Then to install dependencies use
```
npm install
```
and run the server with
```
npm start
```
This will start a local server at `http://localhost:3000`.
